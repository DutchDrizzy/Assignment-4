Music will bring us altogether one day, but in the meantime, we simply must come together to battle climate related issues so that our future children can thrive on a healthy sustainable planet.</h3>

Each male band member has been playing music since they were very young, exploring various forms of their native (cultural music) as well as well classical, rock (old and new) as well as punk from the European scene. The female singer Onhoi moved recently from Norway and has been singing since a child in church choirs.</h2>
